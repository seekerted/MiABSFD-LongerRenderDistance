# MiABSFD Longer Render Distance

## Features

- Enemies from farther away are made visible
- Graphics tweaks for foliage so they render earlier and farther; prevents them from just "popping out" when you walk near them
- Increased the distance of when shadows are rendered, so far away shadows are still visible
